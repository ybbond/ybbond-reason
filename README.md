# reason-ybbond

I tried remaking my personal website using [REasonREact](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/)

previously, it is this website [ybbond.dev](https://ybbond.github.io)

then I tried remaking with React, as seen here [old.ybbond.dev](https://old.ybbond.dev).

finally I stick with Hugo, and now my main site is [ybbond.dev](https://ybbond.dev).
